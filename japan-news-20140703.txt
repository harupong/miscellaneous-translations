Enter France, known as the art attic of Europe before ww2 and where tens of thousands of works were taken from Jewish families by the occupying nazis. Today, more than 2000 pieces returned to France after the war (omission) remain in the custody of the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay and other celebrated French intuitions.

Under pressure for years to get such paintings to their rightful owners, French officials are now trying to clear the books on looted art. Instead of waiting for claimants to come forward, authorities are seeking to trace the ownership of some pieces as they belatedly try to unravel war-era mysteries.

But critics are decrying the French operation as too little, too late.


第二次大戦以前は、フランスといえばヨーロッパの保管庫だった。そして、何万もの芸術品がユダヤ人からナチスによって略奪された場所でもある。戦後、フランスに返却された芸術品のうち、2000以上もの作品が今もルーブル、オルセーといった(著名|名高い)美術館などに保管されたままになっている。
