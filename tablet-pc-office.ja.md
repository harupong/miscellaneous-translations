<!--original
The whole ‘tablets and PCs’ discussion today reminds me a great deal of
similar conversations we used to have a decade ago about ‘laptop or
desktop’. 
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
That is, someone would ask a vaguely technical friend whether they
should buy a laptop or a desktop. And the answer would be “well, how
much money do you have and what do you want to do with it?” Laptops were
portable but had smaller screens, less power and were more expensive.
Which trade-off depended on how you planned to use it. 
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Over time that break point shifted: laptops got less expensive and much
more powerful - today there are very few tasks that need the power a
desktop can give, but the screen size point remains (though of course
external screens are cheap). And so laptops grew to roughly half the PC
market by volume. The desktop market didn’t go away - mostly for screen
size or cost reasons (if you’re outfitting an office of 10k people, none
of whom take their work out of the office, why buy laptops?)

<!--original
Much the same analysis applies to tablets today - "what are you going to
do with it?" Are you going to do sophisticated, complex, multi-app
computing? Lots of keyboard work and detailed manipulation that a mouse
is better for? Apps that are only ON a PC? Then get one (whether desktop
or laptop). Mostly web, email, games, video, social networks and you’re
walking around all the time? A tablet might suit you very well. You
probably have a PC too - there’s very little actual substitution right
now, but there is an impact on the PC replacement cycle (as well  as
expanding the pie massively, especially in emerging markets, which is
another conversation). 
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
And of course this break point will move as well, just as the
laptop/desktop break point did - tablets will get faster and more
sophisticated and capable of substituting more tasks. And so we should
expect to see tablets taking a growing chunk out of the PC market.

<!--original
(The other way to slice this is that the PC market is split very roughly
half and half between consumer and corporate - corporate boxes will
remain longer than consumer PCs, but there’ll be erosion in both.)
-->

<!--original
Another very important lens to look at this through, though, is
Microsoft Office. Office is extremely good (tautologically) at the
things it’s good at - there is no credible alternative to Excel for
making large financial models and no credible alternative to Powerpoint
for making 150-page pitch books, for example. Free alternatives nibble
around the edges, and specialised use cases such as statistics have been
carved out long ago, but the real threats come from use cases where you
shouldn’t really be using Office at all.

<!--original
This ‘shouldn’t use’ comes from both above and below. Someone said to me
on Twitter (I now can’t find who) that their consulting business spent
half its time telling people to stop using Excel and use a database and
the other half telling people to to stop using a database and use Excel.
That is, Excel is used as a business information system in a huge number
of companies. It’s a powerful and flexible IDE on its own terms, and
this is sometimes a good use, but it often isn’t, and specialized SAAS
services will probably carve out an increasing number of these use
cases. When I worked at Orange there was a multi-megabyte Excel file on
the network drive called, I believe, ‘sum\_of\_x.xls’ containing complex
macros and every major operating metric for the entire company, there
for anyone who needed to analyze high-level data. That should probably
not, really, be in Excel today. 
-->

<!--original
The same applies to Powerpoint - it’s a very good tool for that 150
slide deck, but what if you’re making a 10-slide deck each week that
consists entirely of operating metrics pulled out of a back-end system,
manipulated in Excel and pasted into slides, plus commentary, that are
emailed to 25 people? Shouldn’t that change from a 2 hour task to a SAAS
dashboard and a 30-second task? And would it still need a mouse and
keyboard?
-->

<!--original
(This point also bears on the future of email itself, but that's another
topic.)
-->

<!--original
This carving out comes from below, too. One of these is the Google Docs
story, about there can be much debate, but to me the interesting
challenge is embodied by this screenshot - the ‘new file’ menu in
Excel.

How many of these are actually smartphone or tablet apps providing
custom lists or databases? Or [Mint](https://www.mint.com) (another
SAAS)? How many presentation templates might also be something like
[Storehouse](https://www.storehouse.co)?
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
This is, of course, all about unbundling and specialisation. Office apps
(generically) are very broad and deep and general purpose. Critics tend
to focus on the depth and talk about how few people need all those
features, but miss the breadth - of how many things a general purpose
‘table’ app or ‘make pages’ app can be used for (including what look to
technical people like misuses - the classic example being the person who
pastes a screenshot into a Word document and emails that). I'd suggest
that a meaningful proportion of Excel use doesn't involve formulas, for
example, just lists and tables and page layout - IDE as DTP. New routes
to market and new interaction models provide new ways to challenge that
hegemonic interaction model, just as smartphones allow the unbundling of
Facebook's interaction models - SAAS changes Office and so do app
stores.

<!--original
This brings us back to the mouse and keyboard that you ‘need for real
work’, as the phrase goes. Yes, you really do need them to make a
financial model. And you need them to make an operating metrics summary
- in Excel and Powerpoint. But is that, really, what you need to be
doing to achieve the underlying business purpose? Very few people's job
is literally 'make Excel files'. And what if you spend the other 90% of
your time on the road meeting clients and replying to emails? Do you
need a laptop, or a tablet? Do you need a tablet as well as a
smartphone? Or a laptop, or phablet? Or both?

<!--original
Well, what do you want do with it? it’s all just glass - the only real
different is the size and the input mechanism that suits your task.
