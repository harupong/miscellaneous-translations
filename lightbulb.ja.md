<!--original
One person to go to the shop to buy a lightbulb.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Another person who goes and tries to buy a lightbulb but fails because
the shop doesn’t accept Bitcoin. He pops on to Reddit to complain and in
the process [compares his situation to that of the Jews in Nazi
Germany](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1x9pyp/1_simple_reason_why_apple_goes_rotten_%E0%B2%A1_%E0%B2%A1_and_a/).
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Another person to go on to JIRA and spend twenty minutes deciding
whether it is a bug, a support question, a request or one of fifteen
other categories that someone dreamt up as being necessary for “process
reasons”.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
An ops person to spend half a day setting up a virtual private light
fitting environment so you can securely test your lightbulb fittings
without having to be exposed to the evils of the Internet. Having set
this up, he’ll forget to give you a password.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Another ops person who sets up a CI server to tell you whether your
lightbulb is actually on. And some zany co-workers who decide to give
you a lethal electric shock if you cause the CI to go red, because
they’ve got a company culture to uphold. And you wouldn’t want to not be
a culture fit.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
A few managers standing around and looking at the Herculean efforts of
their lightbulb fitting team and wishing they could go ten times faster
even though that would require adding more hours to the day and extra
limbs to their employees. They pass the time by producing Gantt charts
and burndown charts that have almost no relation to reality.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
137 to prepare reports for management on comparing the different types
of lightbulbs and light fixtures and light switches. None of which will
be read; management will instead just choose the lightbulb manufacturer
that buys them lots of drinks and hookers.
-->

<!--original
1 person to poke around on Github for a lightbulb library.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
1 person to package an old, broken version of the lightbulb library for
Debian and Ubuntu and then complain that the fixed one isn’t “stable”
enough.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
20 person to put a slightly less broken version of the lightbulb library
up on an Ubuntu PPA and then neglect to maintain it.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
1 fucking rockstar to tell the guy looking on Github that they all suck
and he’ll write a better one this evening when he’s dosed up on *Red
Bull*.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Someone wearing Google Glass looking like a complete cock.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Someone in a far away land who looks at the lightbulb specification,
doesn’t quite understand it and hops on to LightbulbOverflow and asks in
all caps “CAN YOU SEND ME THE BLUBS BY EMAIL TO
confusedlightblubman@hotmail.com ?”. Management in San Francisco and
London still think outsourcing to this company is a good thing because
they are cheap.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Some consultants in suits saying that the lightbulb isn’t enterprise
ready and needs to be made more modular and hook up to their Enterprise
Service Bridge and Messaging Architecture and to communicate using 17
different SOAP and WS-\* standards dreamed up by people with important
job titles at BEA, Microsoft, Oracle and IBM, but which nobody has
actually ever sat down and implemented without wanting to stab someone
in the face so many times they don’t have a face left. Usually
themselves.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
A few more to argue which type of XML Schema vocabulary (XSD, RELAX NG,
DTD, Schematron etc.) should be used, with one fucking genius deciding
to blow up all the lightbulbs on the planet by launching a [billion
lightbulb DTD attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs) on
the XML architecting team.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
A few young hipsters who point at the XML Schema and SOAP people and
tell them they are ludicrously outdated and need to get with building a
RESTful HTTP API using JSON, but [look blankly at
you](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-07-03-nobody-understands-rest-or-http)
when you ask them what content negotiation is or the difference between
safe and unsafe methods, and then produce you an API that is completely
undocumented, changes every week and doesn’t actually conform to
anything sensible about web architecture.
-->

<!--original
Some idealistic open data person to suggest that maybe they should try
RDF. Fifty people to tell him he’s an idiot.

<!--original
300 or so tossers on Hacker News bitching about how the lightbulb
“doesn’t scale” because the bulb they’ve put in their bedside lamp isn’t
able to double as a floodlight for a fucking soccer stadium.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
A whole bevy of other tossers who decide they don’t like lightbulbs done
in the traditional way so write a fucking library called lightbulb.js
because [“everything that can be written in JavaScript will
be”](http://tommorris.org/posts/8637). The lightbulbs depend on
seventeen JavaScript libraries and silently fail if you fit them in an
old house.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Some arsehole on Lambda the Ultimate who points to an unreadable PDF
filled with mathematical equations proving that unless you know Haskell
you aren’t a good person and should just go die in a fire rather than
bother fitting lightbulbs.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Some other arsehole in the comments on Lambda the Ultimate asking
whether it’s normal that to turn the light switch on, he needs to [do a
Ph.D first](http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html).
-->

<!--original
Twenty odd bloggers writing naff articles about how the
LightbulbStateMutator monad isn’t that complicated and analogising it to
pizzas, roadkill, leprosy, Cher’s new album and some even more
complicated abstract concepts.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
An important looking person in a dark black suit who turns up, insists
that you install a box next to the lightbulb and tells you that you
aren’t allowed to tell anyone about this because of national security
but that if anyone asks, [it’s only
metadata](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/not-just-metadata).
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
One meek university professor suggesting that maybe if you are going to
change a lightbulb, you should get some kind of qualification first,
agree to some kind of lightbulb fitters’ code of conduct and ethics, and
take out some professional indemnity insurance so that if your
incompetence [leads to people
dying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25), people don’t point to
lightbulb fitters and say they are all cowboys and charlatans and
morons.

A few thousand people telling meek university professor to go fuck
himself.

A young lady asking very politely if she can have a turn fitting
lightbulbs once in a while without being cat-called, jeered at or
threatened with rape.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
A couple dozen nice guys telling her to get back in the kitchen, make
them a sandwich and stop being a radical feminist misandrist or they’ll
rape the fucking crap out of her while then explaining that they don’t
understand why anyone would think that women face any issue in the
lightbulb business.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
A couple of venture capitalists who are wearing suit jackets but not
ties so they can look modern saying things like “these lightbulbs seem
like a neat hack but how exactly do you plan to monetize this?” and
“what’s your exit strategy?”
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
A couple of professional lightbulb journalists arguing about who got the
scoop on the fitting of the new lightbulb and sending catty tweets back
and forth about how they suck. And another professional lightbulb
metajournalist to document said catty Twitter fight for his lightbulb
industry gossip blog.

Finally, one person to fit the lightbulb.
