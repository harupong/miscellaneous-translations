For anyone remotely connected to technology, the idea that net neutrality is an unabashed good seems incontrovertible, and one of the most popular examples of why it matters is Netflix. Consumers get a video competitor to their cable provider over said cable provider’s pipes; surely the end of net neutrality would mean the end of Netflix!  For example, consider this section from Netflix CEO Reed Hastings’ [2014 letter to shareholders](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/NFLX/2913616374x0x720306/119321bc-89c3-4306-93ac-93c02da2354f/Q4%2013%20Letter%20to%20shareholders.pdf):

ネットワーク中立性は unabashed good だ、という考え方は、インターネット技術と少しでも関わりあいのある人には議論の余地がないように思えるでしょう。そのネットワーク中立性の、重要性を示す一番の例が Netflix です。Netflix 利用者はケーブルテレビ会社の回線を使って、ケーブルテレビ会社の競合である Netflix が提供するビデオを見ています。ネットワーク中立性の死は Netflix の死をも意味するのです！その具体例として、Netflix CEO の Reed Hastings が今年の初めにシェアホルダー宛に出した[手紙](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/NFLX/2913616374x0x720306/119321bc-89c3-4306-93ac-93c02da2354f/Q4%2013%20Letter%20to%20shareholders.pdf)の内容を見てみましょう。

> 残念ながら、アメリカにおけるネットワーク中立性に対する Verizon の異議申し立てが通ってしまいました。これにより、原則として国内の ISP は、Netflix 会員が Netflix で見ようとした動画の配信を合法的に妨げることができることになります。これは、ISP と Netflix が共同で提供している価値を引き下げるものです。意図としては、それを避けるために Netflix がもっと手数料を ISP に払うようになればいい、ということかもしれません。仮にこのような極めてひどい仮説が現実になるならば、我々は大いに抗議しますし、会員の皆さんには「我々がそのためにお金を払っている、開かれたインターネットを返すよう ISP に求めましょう」とお願いすることでしょう。

<!--original
And yet, just last week, Netflix – without much protest – did exactly what Hastings described: they [paid Comcast](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304834704579401071892041790?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304834704579401071892041790.html&fpid=2,7,121,122,201,401,641,1009) to stop the degradation of Netflix’s services, and are expected to reach a deal with Verizon and other ISPs soon. The stock market promptly punished Netflix, sending the stock down 3.4 percent the day after the announcement.
-->
しかしながら、つい先週、特段の抗議もせず、Netflix は Hastings が語った通りのことを実行しました。彼らは [Comcast に手数料を払い](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304834704579401071892041790?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304834704579401071892041790.html&fpid=2,7,121,122,201,401,641,1009)、Netflix のサービスに Comcast がに課している制限を解除してもらったのです。Verizon、及びいくつかの ISP でも、同じような交渉がまもなく合意に至ると見られています。株式市場はこれに適切に反応し、Netflix の株価は上述のニュース発表の翌日3.4％下落しました。

<!--original
Oh, wait, never mind: the stock was **up** 3.4 percent, [hitting an
all-time
high](http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_25216762/comcast-deal-sends-netflix-record-highs-verizon-may)
of \$447. This may be the opposite of what most tech observers expected,
but Wall Street is not stupid: this is a great deal for Netflix, a
company who has every incentive to *not* support true, end-to-end net
neutrality.
-->
おっと失礼、今のは忘れてください。株価は3.4％**上がり**、[過去最高](http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_25216762/comcast-deal-sends-netflix-record-highs-verizon-may)の447ドルを記録したんでした。テック業界のウォッチャーたちの思惑とは真反対かもしれませんが、ウォールストリートの目は節穴じゃありませんよ。エンドツーエンドでのネットワーク中立性を支持する理由を**一切持たない**企業である Netflix にとって、この合意は素晴らしいものなのです。

<!--original
#### Defining Net Neutrality
-->
## ネットワーク中立性とは？

<!--original
The first problem with the net neutrality debate is that there are three
competing definitions:
-->
ネットワーク中立性に関する議論でまず問題になるのが、3つの相反する定義の存在です。

<!--original
-   **The public definition** – For most people, particularly those of
    us in the tech industry, net neutrality means non-discrimination
    against packets from origin to destination. A packet from Netflix or
    YouTube or PornHub or the New York Times is treated and priced the
    exact same from server to client and back again.
-->
-   **The public definition** – ネットワーク中立性というのは、大半の人、特にテック業界に身を置く我々のような者にとっては、パケットが発信元から受信先までの経路で一切区別されない、ということを指します。パケットが Netflix からのものであれ、YouTube や PronHub やニューヨークタイムズからのものであれ、サーバーとクライアントの間を行き来する間は同じように取り扱われ、かつ課金される、ということです。

<!--original
-   **The legal definition** – The FCC’s [Open Internet
    rules](http://www.fcc.gov/guides/open-internet), which were ruled as [overreaching](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-14/verizon-wins-net-neutrality-court-ruling-against-fcc.html) by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, yet still apply to Comcast due to an agreement they signed as part of their acquisition of NBC Universal, only ever applied to traffic *within* an ISP’s network; in other words, once data is within Comcast or Verizon’s network, they can’t discriminate, delivering some data faster or slower. The Netflix/Comcast deal, on the other hand, is about peering: the point at which data enters the Comcast network (there is a useful overview of peering available [here](http://www.btigresearch.com/2014/02/11/forget-net-neutrality-peering-and-interconnection-set-to-be-the-internet-issue-of-2014/#ixzz2tEtvJnuH)).  This is not (and never was) covered by net neutrality, as many geeks are now learning to their dismay.
-->
-   **The legal definition** – FCC の [中立性規則](http://www.fcc.gov/guides/open-internet) は、[行き過ぎである](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-14/verizon-wins-net-neutrality-court-ruling-against-fcc.html)として米連邦控訴裁判所によって無効判決が下されましたが、NBC Universal 買収時の合意事項の一環として Comcast には適用されたままになっています。ただし、その規則自体は ISP ネットワーク*内*の通信にのみ適用されてきました。すなわち、一度データが Comcast や Verizon のネットワークに入ってしまえば、優先したり制限をかけたりするために区別することができなくなる、ということです。一方、Netflix/Comcast の合意は、Comcast のネットワークにデータが入る入口、ピアリングに関するものでした (ピアリングの詳細は[ここ](http://www.btigresearch.com/2014/02/11/forget-net-neutrality-peering-and-interconnection-set-to-be-the-internet-issue-of-2014/#ixzz2tEtvJnuH)を参照してください。)。ピアリングは、これまでも現在も、ネットワーク中立性の範囲には含まれておらず、ギークたちはそれを知ってがっかりしているわけです。

<!--original
-   **The Netflix definition** – Netflix has a subtly different view,
    best articulated by Reed Hastings himself in [a Facebook
    post](https://www.facebook.com/reed1960/posts/10150706947044584) two
    years ago:
-->

<!--original
    > Comcast no longer following net neutrality principles.
    >
    > Comcast should apply caps equally, or not at all.
    >
    > I spent the weekend enjoying four good internet video apps on my
    > Xbox: Netflix, HBO GO, Xfinity, and Hulu.
    >
    > When I watch video on my Xbox from three of these four apps, it
    > counts against my Comcast internet cap. When I watch through
    > Comcast’s Xfinity app, however, it does not count against my

    > For example, if I watch last night’s SNL episode on my Xbox
    > through the Hulu app, it eats up about one gigabyte of my cap, but
    > if I watch that same episode through the Xfinity Xbox app, it
    > doesn’t use up my cap at all.
    >
    > The same device, the same IP address, the same wifi, the same
    > internet connection, but totally different cap treatment.
    >
    > In what way is this neutral?

[translation here]

<!--original
    What Netflix is most concerned about from a non-discrimination
    standpoint [are broadband
    caps](http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7021917119), and,
    more broadly, usage-based broadband pricing. It’s not that their
    position differs on a point-by-point basis from most net neutrality
    advocates; rather, the priorities are different.

#### Why the Comcast Agreement is Good for Netflix
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
This deal is in many ways a win-win for Netflix: they are likely paying
less for better quality.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Previously Netflix paid backbone providers such as Cogent for transit;
it was then Cogent’s responsibility to interface with last mile provides
such as Comcast or Verizon. Cogent [made a lot of
noise](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/netflix-packets-being-dropped-every-day-because-verizon-wants-more-money/)
about Comcast and other ISPs wanting to get paid on both sides – by
customers for Internet access, and Cogent for peering agreements – but
the truth is Cogent was just as duplicitous: they wanted to be paid by
Netflix on one side, and effectively subsidized by ISPs on the other.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Free peering agreements between Internet providers were premised on the
idea that a roughly equal amount of traffic was going in both
directions, meaning there was no net increase in cost as a result of a
peering agreement. Netflix, though, changed that equation by moving as
much as 30% of all the United States’ internet traffic in one direction
(on Cogent’s backbone). Cogent’s insistence on “free” peering, then, was
not at all consistent with such previous agreements: Cogent was not
carrying an in-kind amount of traffic in exchange for the traffic they
were dumping onto ISPs.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
As an analogy, suppose my friend Bob and I agreed to watch the other’s
dog in the event of a trip or vacation. We both travel about three weeks
of the year, so while I have to watch Bob’s dog for three weeks, he
watches mine for three weeks as well. While the specific amount of
travel may vary year-by-year, it all evens out in the end, and we’re
both happy. A few years later, though, I take a job as a consultant, and
am suddenly traveling 30 weeks a year. Wouldn’t it be unfair for me to
insist that Bob hold to the terms of our agreement, even though it
entails him watching my dog 27 weeks more than I watch his? Yet that is
exactly what Cogent was demanding for direct access to ISPs’ networks,
and the ISPs in turn demanded compensation (keep in mind, Netflix has
*always* been free to use the open Internet to reach customers; they
simply find the performance unacceptable and wants shortcuts into ISP
networks).
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
With this deal, Netflix has effectively cut out the middleman Cogent,
and is sending traffic directly from their servers onto Comcast’s
network. Not only will this mean better quality for Netflix customers on
Comcast, but it also raises the barrier of entry for potential Netflix
competitors. Netflix currently has unique leverage over Comcast due to
Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner, which, combined with their
brand name and favorability amongst customers and regulators likely
meant they got a [great
deal](http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/why-netflix-is-actually-the-big-winner-in-the-comcast-bandwidth-deal-1201118421/);
future Netflix competitors, forced to go over the open Internet or rely
on providers like Cogent will be at both a cost and quality
disadvantage.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Most importantly, though, Netflix has to be thrilled that *Netflix* –
not end-users – is paying for better Netflix video, shrouding the extent
to which end-users are subsidizing Netflix.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
#### Who Pays for Broadband?
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
There’s no question, at least in my mind, that broadband is just as much
a requirement for day-to-day life as is electricity, water, sewage,
paved roads, etc. And, like said utilities, broadband lends itself to a
[natural monopoly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly); the
cost of capital for building out a network are so great that the
economics demand a single provider.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
The primary way to deal with natural monopolies is to either have said
service provided by the government or provided by a private firm that is
heavily regulated with strict requirements about widespread access
combined with (relatively) high prices. This is indeed the case with
electricity, water, sewage, and
roads.^[1](#footnote_0_696 "Problems with these models arise when pricing becomes unregulated, or not included at all")^
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
The problem with regulating broadband in this way, though, is that the
definition of acceptable broadband is much more of a moving target. As
Marc Andreessen memorably put it on Twitter:
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
> [@mattyglesias](https://twitter.com/mattyglesias)
> [@binarybits](https://twitter.com/binarybits) Because sewers and
> electricity are far more static markets than broadband. You don't shit
> 10x as much every 3 yrs.
>
> — Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) [February 23,
> 2014](https://twitter.com/pmarca/statuses/437683055629570048)
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Remember, the United States is a country where one of the two major
political parties routinely threatens to default on the nation’s debt to
score political points. Infrastructure investment is embarrassingly low
in things like roads and bridges, much less in environmentally
sustainable power like
nuclear;^[2](#footnote_1_696 "If there is one thing to take away from this article as a whole, it is that everything is a tradeoff. I know my aside on nuclear just upset a lot of you, but when you consider the relative cost and capacity of wind, solar, etc, and the environmental destruction caused by fossil fuels, non-polluting nuclear and its spent fuel risks makes a lot of sense. Tradeoffs.")^
to put the future of broadband, something that requires continual
investment, into the hands of such a dysfunctional government seems
foolhardy at best.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
And yet, the fact that wired broadband in particular is a natural
monopoly remains, raising the question of how you incentivize investment
in ever faster broadband? There are three main
options:^[3](#footnote_2_696 "Google Fiber is a fourth: building a straight-up competitor, natural monopoly economics be damned. It’s possible because Google already has its own backhaul network, but I have trouble seeing how it will scale at least in the near term")^
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
-   **Government mandate** – Given the assumption that broadband is a
    economic necessity, this is the prescription that follows.
    Unfortunately, the same pragmatic problems that make
    government-provided broadband a likely non-starter plague this as
    well; Republicans in particular have actively opposed any sort of
    telecom regulation, even before you get to the incentive problems of
    mandates versus markets.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
-   **Discriminatory pricing** – Companies like Amazon know that [every
    100ms
    delay](http://blog.gigaspaces.com/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/)
    causes them to lose sales; that makes guaranteed access to end users
    exceptionally valuable. It’s the same thing with Google, Netflix,
    and most other Internet companies. Comcast and other ISPs would
    certainly be incentivized to improve their networks if they knew
    that said companies would compensate them accordingly.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
    To some extent, this is exactly what just happened with the Netflix
    peering agreement, although true discrimination within their network
    would incentivize Comcast even more.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
-   **Usage-based pricing** – With usage-based pricing, if you use more
    data, you pay more; use less, pay less. As we’ve seen with wireless,
    this strongly incentivizes network providers to increase broadband
    capacity. It’s no accident that the rollout of LTE in the US was
    combined with the imposition of data caps, just as it’s not an
    accident that the US has far better LTE penetration than anywhere
    else in the world. This despite the fact that providing wireless
    service in the US is much more difficult than just about anywhere
    else in the world due to sheer physical size and effective
    NIMBYism.^[4](#footnote_3_696 "NIMBY = Not In My BackYard")^ AT&T,
    Verizon, etc. want you to use as much data as possible as quickly as
    possible, and to charge you for the privilege.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
#### Making Tradeoffs
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
In the end, each of these options presents a different set of tradeoffs
among three competing ideals:
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
-   Continual investment in faster and more accessible broadband
-   Non-discriminatory treatment of data
-   Unlimited access
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
There is no approach, at least given the United State’s political
realities, that allows for all three; this is “Fast/Good/Cheap Choose
Two” applied to Internet access.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Thus, we need to make choices based on priorities. From my perspective,
the most important of these ideals is the non-discriminatory treatment
of data. This is what makes the Internet so profound, and what enables
new companies to disrupt the market and improve the lives of millions.
It must be protected not just within an ISPs network, but all across the
entire Internet including peering.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
The second most important is continual investment in faster and more
accessible broadband. The flip-side of the Internet being so profound is
that improved access has an exponential return both from an economic as
well as from a societal impact perspective.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
That leaves unlimited access on the chopping block. While I love the
idea of unlimited data, I also am aware that nothing comes for free; in
the case of unlimited data, the cost we are paying is underinvestment
and/or discriminatory treatment of data. Therefore I believe the best
approach to broadband is usage-based payment by both upstream and
downstream, with no payments in the middle.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
The way this would have played out in the case of Netflix is that:
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
-   Netflix would pay more at the point of origin to compensate backbone
    providers for the massive amount of data they generate
-   ISP customers who watch the most video would pay more
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
It’s the latter result that terrifies Netflix, and is why, in the end,
they are not an ally of those of us who desire true net neutrality.
Currently non-Netflix broadband subscribers are effectively subsidizing
Netflix viewers; they use much less capacity, yet pay the same price.
This needs to change for the sake of true net neutrality, and if it
results in Netflix losing subscribers, so be it.
-->

[translation here]

<!--original
Unfortunately, this agreement and the others that are soon to follow
makes such an arrangement unlikely. Comcast and company are getting
paid, so they’re happy, and Netflix is disguising their true cost to end
users so they are happy as well. It’s non-Netflix users, and, more
distressingly, the startups and services that have yet to be created who
are ultimately paying the price.
